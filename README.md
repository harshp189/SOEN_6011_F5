### SOEN6011 - Software Engineering Processes

### ETERNITY


This repository contains the implementation and detailed description
of the transcendental function : **ab^x** , It is exponential function 
with three variables, a (initial value), b (base) and x (exponent). 
The report for the same is divided into many sections including the 
Description, Characteristics , Eliciting Requirements for the function
, Pseudocode and Algorithms for the function, Implementing it from 
scratch in Java, Using debugger, expressing efforts made towards
achieving various quality attributes, checking the pragmatic quality
of the code using Checkstyle tool and at last designing several unit
test cases using unit testing framework like Junit 4 and tracing 
them with the requirements.

**Steps for build Jar File (From IntelliJ IDE):**
1. Go to the Project Structure of the Project
2. Select the Artifacts tab and click on the ‘+’ sign and select option of JAR (from module with dependencies)
3. Select the main class and click ok and accept all the default settings.
4. From Build menu, select the Build Artifacts option and build it.
5. The generated .jar file can be found in the out\artifacts\SOEN_6011_F5_jar\SOEN_6011_F5.jar
6. Copy the absolute path and open the cmd terminal.
7. Type the command java -jar absolute_path.


**For running the system:**

After executing the **SOEN_6011_F5.jar** jar file, follow these steps :
1. Provide the input values for a, b and x.
2. The output of the exponential function ab^x will be displayed on the screen.
3. You can terminate the program by pressing e/E or press any other key to continue the computation.

For running the system on **IntelliJ IDE** follow these steps :
A simple text-based user interface is designed to execute the function.
1. Execute the Main.java file.
2. Provide the input values for a, b and x.
3. The output of the exponential function ab^x will be displayed on the screen.

In both the cases, in case of any errors the corresponding error message will be displayed.
